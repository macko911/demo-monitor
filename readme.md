# üíÇ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Digitoo monitoring service

This app lets you monitor selected URLs by periodically sending requests to them and storing responses that can be viewed in the browser using the frontend app.

## Getting started

If you have Docker installed, you should be able to start the app simply by running
```bash
docker-compose up
```

If that works for you, proceed to the [Usage](#usage) section.

For non-Docker development, please continue reading.

First we need to install Node dependencies using our favourite packages manager in the root of the project, f.e.

```bash
yarn
# or
npm install
```

## Development

We have separate development servers for backend (using `nodemon` and `ts-node`) and frontend (using `Next.js`).

To start both servers simultaneously, run
```bash
yarn dev
# or
npm run dev
```

Frontend is served at http://localhost:3000  
Backend is served at http://localhost:8080

Code changes are propagated without having to manually restart the servers.

We use `concurrently` package to run multiple npm scripts at the same time, ensuring cross-platform compatibility.

## Usage

### Environmental variables

Before running the app, we need to have a valid `.env` file in the `/server` folder where we store our secrets. Simply rename the `.env.default` file to `.env` and fill in the empty values.
```
FAUNA_DB_SECRET=
JWT_SECRET=
```

### Authentication

In order to test the app, we first need to get an accessToken via the `/login` endpoint.

#### Test users

### Database

We're using a modern serverless database [FaunaDB](https://fauna.com/).
